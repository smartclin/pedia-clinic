This page provides an overview of **all** the folder and file conventions in Next.js, and recommendations for organizing your project.

## Folder and file conventions

### Top-level folders

Top-level folders are used to organize your application's code and static assets.

| [`src`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/src-folder)       | Optional application source folder |

### Top-level files

Top-level files are used to configure your application, manage dependencies, run proxy, integrate monitoring tools, and define environment variables.

### Routing Files

Add `page` to expose a route, `layout` for shared UI such as header, nav, or footer, `loading` for skeletons, `error` for error boundaries, and `route` for APIs.

|                                                                               |                     |                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| [`layout`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout)                   | `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx` | Layout                       |
| [`page`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page)                       | `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx` | Page                         |
| [`loading`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading)                 | `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx` | Loading UI                   |
| [`not-found`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/not-found)             | `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx` | Not found UI                 |
| [`error`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/error)                     | `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx` | Error UI                     |

| [`route`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route)                     | `.js` `.ts`         | API endpoint                 |
| [`template`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/template)               | `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx` | Re-rendered layout           |

### Nested routes

Folders define URL segments. Nesting folders nests segments. Layouts at any level wrap their child segments. A route becomes public when a `page` or `route` file exists.

| Path                        | URL pattern     | Notes                         |
| --------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `app/layout.tsx`            | —               | Root layout wraps all routes  |
| `app/blog/layout.tsx`       | —               | Wraps `/blog` and descendants |
| `app/page.tsx`              | `/`             | Public route                  |
| `app/blog/page.tsx`         | `/blog`         | Public route                  |
| `app/blog/authors/page.tsx` | `/blog/authors` | Public route                  |

### Dynamic routes

Parameterize segments with square brackets. Use `[segment]` for a single param, `[...segment]` for catch‑all, and `[[...segment]]` for optional catch‑all. Access values via the [`params`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#params-optional) prop.

| Path                            | URL pattern                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`      | `/blog/my-first-post`                                                |
| `app/shop/[...slug]/page.tsx`   | `/shop/clothing`, `/shop/clothing/shirts`                            |
| `app/docs/[[...slug]]/page.tsx` | `/docs`, `/docs/layouts-and-pages`, `/docs/api-reference/use-router` |

### Route groups and private folders

Organize code without changing URLs with route groups [`(group)`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-groups#convention), and colocate non-routable files with private folders [`_folder`](#private-folders).

| Path                            | URL pattern | Notes                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `app/(marketing)/page.tsx`      | `/`         | Group omitted from URL                    |
| `app/(shop)/cart/page.tsx`      | `/cart`     | Share layouts within `(shop)`             |
| `app/blog/_components/Post.tsx` | —           | Not routable; safe place for UI utilities |
| `app/blog/_lib/data.ts`         | —           | Not routable; safe place for utils        |

### Parallel and Intercepted Routes

These features fit specific UI patterns, such as slot-based layouts or modal routing.

Use `@slot` for named slots rendered by a parent layout. Use intercept patterns to render another route inside the current layout without changing the URL, for example, to show a details view as a modal over a list.

| Pattern (docs)                                                                              | Meaning              | Typical use case                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| [`@folder`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/parallel-routes#slots)                 | Named slot           | Sidebar + main content                   |
| [`(.)folder`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/intercepting-routes#convention)      | Intercept same level | Preview sibling route in a modal         |
| [`(..)folder`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/intercepting-routes#convention)     | Intercept parent     | Open a child of the parent as an overlay |
| [`(..)(..)folder`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/intercepting-routes#convention) | Intercept two levels | Deeply nested overlay                    |
| [`(...)folder`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/intercepting-routes#convention)    | Intercept from root  | Show arbitrary route in current view     |

## Organizing your project

Next.js is **unopinionated** about how you organize and colocate your project files. But it does provide several features to help you organize your project.

### Component hierarchy

The components defined in special files are rendered in a specific hierarchy:

* `layout.js`
* `template.js`
* `error.js` (React error boundary)
* `loading.js` (React suspense boundary)
* `not-found.js` (React error boundary for "not found" UI)
* `page.js` or nested `layout.js`

![Component Hierarchy for File Conventions](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/file-conventions-component-hierarchy.png)

The components are rendered recursively in nested routes, meaning the components of a route segment will be nested **inside** the components of its parent segment.

![Nested File Conventions Component Hierarchy](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/nested-file-conventions-component-hierarchy.png)

### Colocation

In the `app` directory, nested folders define route structure. Each folder represents a route segment that is mapped to a corresponding segment in a URL path.

However, even though route structure is defined through folders, a route is **not publicly accessible** until a `page.js` or `route.js` file is added to a route segment.

![A diagram showing how a route is not publicly accessible until a page.js or route.js file is added to a route segment.](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/project-organization-not-routable.png)

And, even when a route is made publicly accessible, only the **content returned** by `page.js` or `route.js` is sent to the client.

![A diagram showing how page.js and route.js files make routes publicly accessible.](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/project-organization-routable.png)

This means that **project files** can be **safely colocated** inside route segments in the `app` directory without accidentally being routable.

![A diagram showing colocated project files are not routable even when a segment contains a page.js or route.js file.](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/project-organization-colocation.png)

> **Good to know**: While you **can** colocate your project files in `app` you don't **have** to. If you prefer, you can [keep them outside the `app` directory](#store-project-files-outside-of-app).

### Private folders

Private folders can be created by prefixing a folder with an underscore: `_folderName`

This indicates the folder is a private implementation detail and should not be considered by the routing system, thereby **opting the folder and all its subfolders** out of routing.

![An example folder structure using private folders](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/project-organization-private-folders.png)

Since files in the `app` directory can be [safely colocated by default](#colocation), private folders are not required for colocation. However, they can be useful for:

* Separating UI logic from routing logic.
* Consistently organizing internal files across a project and the Next.js ecosystem.
* Sorting and grouping files in code editors.
* Avoiding potential naming conflicts with future Next.js file conventions.

> **Good to know**:
>
> * While not a framework convention, you might also consider marking files outside private folders as "private" using the same underscore pattern.
> * You can create URL segments that start with an underscore by prefixing the folder name with `%5F` (the URL-encoded form of an underscore): `%5FfolderName`.
> * If you don't use private folders, it would be helpful to know Next.js [special file conventions](/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#routing-files) to prevent unexpected naming conflicts.

### Route groups

Route groups can be created by wrapping a folder in parenthesis: `(folderName)`

This indicates the folder is for organizational purposes and should **not be included** in the route's URL path.

![An example folder structure using route groups](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/project-organization-route-groups.png)

Route groups are useful for:

* Organizing routes by site section, intent, or team. e.g. marketing pages, admin pages, etc.
* Enabling nested layouts in the same route segment level:
  * [Creating multiple nested layouts in the same segment, including multiple root layouts](#creating-multiple-root-layouts)
  * [Adding a layout to a subset of routes in a common segment](#opting-specific-segments-into-a-layout)

### `src` folder

Next.js supports storing application code (including `app`) inside an optional [`src` folder](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/src-folder). This separates application code from project configuration files which mostly live in the root of a project.

![An example folder structure with the src folder](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/project-organization-src-directory.png)

## Examples

The following section lists a very high-level overview of common strategies. The simplest takeaway is to choose a strategy that works for you and your team and be consistent across the project.

> **Good to know**: In our examples below, we're using `components` and `lib` folders as generalized placeholders, their naming has no special framework significance and your projects might use other folders like `ui`, `utils`, `hooks`, `styles`, etc.

### Store project files outside of `app`

This strategy stores all application code in shared folders in the **root of your project** and keeps the `app` directory purely for routing purposes.

![An example folder structure with project files outside of app](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/project-organization-project-root.png)

### Store project files in top-level folders inside of `app`

This strategy stores all application code in shared folders in the **root of the `app` directory**.

![An example folder structure with project files inside app](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/project-organization-app-root.png)

### Split project files by feature or route

This strategy stores globally shared application code in the root `app` directory and **splits** more specific application code into the route segments that use them.

![An example folder structure with project files split by feature or route](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/project-organization-app-root-split.png)

### Organize routes without affecting the URL path

To organize routes without affecting the URL, create a group to keep related routes together. The folders in parenthesis will be omitted from the URL (e.g. `(marketing)` or `(shop)`).

![Organizing Routes with Route Groups](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/route-group-organisation.png)

Even though routes inside `(marketing)` and `(shop)` share the same URL hierarchy, you can create a different layout for each group by adding a `layout.js` file inside their folders.

![Route Groups with Multiple Layouts](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/route-group-multiple-layouts.png)

### Opting specific segments into a layout

To opt specific routes into a layout, create a new route group (e.g. `(shop)`) and move the routes that share the same layout into the group (e.g. `account` and `cart`). The routes outside of the group will not share the layout (e.g. `checkout`).

![Route Groups with Opt-in Layouts](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/route-group-opt-in-layouts.png)

### Opting for loading skeletons on a specific route

To apply a [loading skeleton](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading) via a `loading.js` file to a specific route, create a new route group (e.g., `/(overview)`) and then move your `loading.tsx` inside that route group.

![Folder structure showing a loading.tsx and a page.tsx inside the route group](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/route-group-loading.png)

Now, the `loading.tsx` file will only apply to your dashboard → overview page instead of all your dashboard pages without affecting the URL path structure.

### Creating multiple root layouts

To create multiple [root layouts](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout#root-layout), remove the top-level `layout.js` file, and add a `layout.js` file inside each route group. This is useful for partitioning an application into sections that have a completely different UI or experience. The `<html>` and `<body>` tags need to be added to each root layout.

![Route Groups with Multiple Root Layouts](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/route-group-multiple-root-layouts.png)

In the example above, both `(marketing)` and `(shop)` have their own root layout.

# Layouts and Pages
@doc-version: 16.1.6
@last-updated: 2026-02-11


Next.js uses **file-system based routing**, meaning you can use folders and files to define routes. This page will guide you through how to create layouts and pages, and link between them.

## Creating a page

A **page** is UI that is rendered on a specific route. To create a page, add a [`page` file](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page) inside the `app` directory and default export a React component. For example, to create an index page (`/`):

![page.js special file](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/page-special-file.png)

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
export default function Page() {
  return <h1>Hello Next.js!</h1>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" switcher
export default function Page() {
  return <h1>Hello Next.js!</h1>
}
```

## Creating a layout

A layout is UI that is **shared** between multiple pages. On navigation, layouts preserve state, remain interactive, and do not rerender.

You can define a layout by default exporting a React component from a [`layout` file](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout). The component should accept a `children` prop which can be a page or another [layout](#nesting-layouts).

For example, to create a layout that accepts your index page as child, add a `layout` file inside the `app` directory:

![layout.js special file](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/layout-special-file.png)

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx" switcher
export default function DashboardLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        {/* Layout UI */}
        {/* Place children where you want to render a page or nested layout */}
        <main>{children}</main>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/layout.js" switcher
export default function DashboardLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        {/* Layout UI */}
        {/* Place children where you want to render a page or nested layout */}
        <main>{children}</main>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

The layout above is called a [root layout](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout#root-layout) because it's defined at the root of the `app` directory. The root layout is **required** and must contain `html` and `body` tags.

## Creating a nested route

A nested route is a route composed of multiple URL segments. For example, the `/blog/[slug]` route is composed of three segments:

* `/` (Root Segment)
* `blog` (Segment)
* `[slug]` (Leaf Segment)

In Next.js:

* **Folders** are used to define the route segments that map to URL segments.
* **Files** (like `page` and `layout`) are used to create UI that is shown for a segment.

To create nested routes, you can nest folders inside each other. For example, to add a route for `/blog`, create a folder called `blog` in the `app` directory. Then, to make `/blog` publicly accessible, add a `page.tsx` file:

![File hierarchy showing blog folder and a page.js file](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/blog-nested-route.png)

```tsx filename="app/blog/page.tsx" switcher
// Dummy imports
import { getPosts } from '@/lib/posts'
import { Post } from '@/ui/post'

export default async function Page() {
  const posts = await getPosts()

  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <Post key={post.id} post={post} />
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/page.js" switcher
// Dummy imports
import { getPosts } from '@/lib/posts'
import { Post } from '@/ui/post'

export default async function Page() {
  const posts = await getPosts()

  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <Post key={post.id} post={post} />
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

You can continue nesting folders to create nested routes. For example, to create a route for a specific blog post, create a new `[slug]` folder inside `blog` and add a `page` file:

![File hierarchy showing blog folder with a nested slug folder and a page.js file](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/blog-post-nested-route.png)

```tsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx" switcher
function generateStaticParams() {}

export default function Page() {
  return <h1>Hello, Blog Post Page!</h1>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/page.js" switcher
function generateStaticParams() {}

export default function Page() {
  return <h1>Hello, Blog Post Page!</h1>
}
```

Wrapping a folder name in square brackets (e.g. `[slug]`) creates a [dynamic route segment](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/dynamic-routes) which is used to generate multiple pages from data. e.g. blog posts, product pages, etc.

## Nesting layouts

By default, layouts in the folder hierarchy are also nested, which means they wrap child layouts via their `children` prop. You can nest layouts by adding `layout` inside specific route segments (folders).

For example, to create a layout for the `/blog` route, add a new `layout` file inside the `blog` folder.

![File hierarchy showing root layout wrapping the blog layout](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/nested-layouts.png)

```tsx filename="app/blog/layout.tsx" switcher
export default function BlogLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return <section>{children}</section>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/blog/layout.js" switcher
export default function BlogLayout({ children }) {
  return <section>{children}</section>
}
```

If you were to combine the two layouts above, the root layout (`app/layout.js`) would wrap the blog layout (`app/blog/layout.js`), which would wrap the blog (`app/blog/page.js`) and blog post page (`app/blog/[slug]/page.js`).

## Creating a dynamic segment

[Dynamic segments](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/dynamic-routes) allow you to create routes that are generated from data. For example, instead of manually creating a route for each individual blog post, you can create a dynamic segment to generate the routes based on blog post data.

To create a dynamic segment, wrap the segment (folder) name in square brackets: `[segmentName]`. For example, in the `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` route, the `[slug]` is the dynamic segment.

```tsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx" switcher
export default async function BlogPostPage({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>
}) {
  const { slug } = await params
  const post = await getPost(slug)

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/page.js" switcher
export default async function BlogPostPage({ params }) {
  const { slug } = await params
  const post = await getPost(slug)

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Learn more about [Dynamic Segments](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/dynamic-routes) and the [`params`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#params-optional) props.

Nested [layouts within Dynamic Segments](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout#params-optional), can also access the `params` props.

## Rendering with search params

In a Server Component **page**, you can access search parameters using the [`searchParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#searchparams-optional) prop:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
export default async function Page({
  searchParams,
}: {
  searchParams: Promise<{ [key: string]: string | string[] | undefined }>
}) {
  const filters = (await searchParams).filters
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.jsx" switcher
export default async function Page({ searchParams }) {
  const filters = (await searchParams).filters
}
```

Using `searchParams` opts your page into [**dynamic rendering**](/docs/app/guides/caching#dynamic-rendering) because it requires an incoming request to read the search parameters from.

Client Components can read search params using the [`useSearchParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params) hook.

Learn more about `useSearchParams` in [statically rendered](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params#static-rendering) and [dynamically rendered](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params#dynamic-rendering) routes.

### What to use and when

* Use the `searchParams` prop when you need search parameters to **load data for the page** (e.g. pagination, filtering from a database).
* Use `useSearchParams` when search parameters are used **only on the client** (e.g. filtering a list already loaded via props).
* As a small optimization, you can use `new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)` in **callbacks or event handlers** to read search params without triggering re-renders.

## Linking between pages

You can use the [`<Link>` component](/docs/app/api-reference/components/link) to navigate between routes. `<Link>` is a built-in Next.js component that extends the HTML `<a>` tag to provide [prefetching](/docs/app/getting-started/linking-and-navigating#prefetching) and [client-side navigation](/docs/app/getting-started/linking-and-navigating#client-side-transitions).

For example, to generate a list of blog posts, import `<Link>` from `next/link` and pass a `href` prop to the component:

```tsx filename="app/ui/post.tsx" highlight={1,10} switcher
import Link from 'next/link'

export default async function Post({ post }) {
  const posts = await getPosts()

  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.slug}>
          <Link href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}>{post.title}</Link>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/ui/post.js" highlight={1,10}  switcher
import Link from 'next/link'

export default async function Post({ post }) {
  const posts = await getPosts()

  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.slug}>
          <Link href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}>{post.title}</Link>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

> **Good to know**: `<Link>` is the primary way to navigate between routes in Next.js. You can also use the [`useRouter` hook](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-router) for more advanced navigation.

## Route Props Helpers

Next.js exposes utility types that infer `params` and named slots from your route structure:

* [**PageProps**](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#page-props-helper): Props for `page` components, including `params` and `searchParams`.
* [**LayoutProps**](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout#layout-props-helper): Props for `layout` components, including `children` and any named slots (e.g. folders like `@analytics`).

These are globally available helpers, generated when running either `next dev`, `next build` or [`next typegen`](/docs/app/api-reference/cli/next#next-typegen-options).

```tsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx"
export default async function Page(props: PageProps<'/blog/[slug]'>) {
  const { slug } = await props.params
  return <h1>Blog post: {slug}</h1>
}
```

```tsx filename="app/dashboard/layout.tsx"
export default function Layout(props: LayoutProps<'/dashboard'>) {
  return (
    <section>
      {props.children}
      {/* If you have app/dashboard/@analytics, it appears as a typed slot: */}
      {/* {props.analytics} */}
    </section>
  )
}
```

> **Good to know**
>
> * Static routes resolve `params` to `{}`.
> * `PageProps`, `LayoutProps` are global helpers — no imports required.
> * Types are generated during `next dev`, `next build` or `next typegen`.

# Linking and Navigating
@doc-version: 16.1.6
@last-updated: 2026-02-11


In Next.js, routes are rendered on the server by default. This often means the client has to wait for a server response before a new route can be shown. Next.js comes with built-in [prefetching](#prefetching), [streaming](#streaming), and [client-side transitions](#client-side-transitions) ensuring navigation stays fast and responsive.

This guide explains how navigation works in Next.js and how you can optimize it for [dynamic routes](#dynamic-routes-without-loadingtsx) and [slow networks](#slow-networks).

## How navigation works

To understand how navigation works in Next.js, it helps to be familiar with the following concepts:

* [Server Rendering](#server-rendering)
* [Prefetching](#prefetching)
* [Streaming](#streaming)
* [Client-side transitions](#client-side-transitions)

### Server Rendering

In Next.js, [Layouts and Pages](/docs/app/getting-started/layouts-and-pages) are [React Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) by default. On initial and subsequent navigations, the [Server Component Payload](/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components#how-do-server-and-client-components-work-in-nextjs) is generated on the server before being sent to the client.

There are two types of server rendering, based on *when* it happens:

* **Static Rendering (or Prerendering)** happens at build time or during [revalidation](/docs/app/getting-started/caching-and-revalidating) and the result is cached.
* **Dynamic Rendering** happens at request time in response to a client request.

The trade-off of server rendering is that the client must wait for the server to respond before the new route can be shown. Next.js addresses this delay by [prefetching](#prefetching) routes the user is likely to visit and performing [client-side transitions](#client-side-transitions).

> **Good to know**: HTML is also generated for the initial visit.

### Prefetching

Prefetching is the process of loading a route in the background before the user navigates to it. This makes navigation between routes in your application feel instant, because by the time a user clicks on a link, the data to render the next route is already available client side.

Next.js automatically prefetches routes linked with the [`<Link>` component](/docs/app/api-reference/components/link) when they enter the user's viewport.

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx" switcher
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <nav>
          {/* Prefetched when the link is hovered or enters the viewport */}
          <Link href="/blog">Blog</Link>
          {/* No prefetching */}
          <a href="/contact">Contact</a>
        </nav>
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/layout.js" switcher
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Layout() {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <nav>
          {/* Prefetched when the link is hovered or enters the viewport */}
          <Link href="/blog">Blog</Link>
          {/* No prefetching */}
          <a href="/contact">Contact</a>
        </nav>
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

How much of the route is prefetched depends on whether it's static or dynamic:

* **Static Route**: the full route is prefetched.
* **Dynamic Route**: prefetching is skipped, or the route is partially prefetched if [`loading.tsx`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading) is present.

By skipping or partially prefetching dynamic routes, Next.js avoids unnecessary work on the server for routes the users may never visit. However, waiting for a server response before navigation can give the users the impression that the app is not responding.

![Server Rendering without Streaming](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/server-rendering-without-streaming.png)

To improve the navigation experience to dynamic routes, you can use [streaming](#streaming).

### Streaming

Streaming allows the server to send parts of a dynamic route to the client as soon as they're ready, rather than waiting for the entire route to be rendered. This means users see something sooner, even if parts of the page are still loading.

For dynamic routes, it means they can be **partially prefetched**. That is, shared layouts and loading skeletons can be requested ahead of time.

![How Server Rendering with Streaming Works](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/server-rendering-with-streaming.png)

To use streaming, create a `loading.tsx` in your route folder:

![loading.js special file](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/loading-special-file.png)

```tsx filename="app/dashboard/loading.tsx" switcher
export default function Loading() {
  // Add fallback UI that will be shown while the route is loading.
  return <LoadingSkeleton />
}
```

```jsx filename="app/dashboard/loading.js" switcher
export default function Loading() {
  // Add fallback UI that will be shown while the route is loading.
  return <LoadingSkeleton />
}
```

Behind the scenes, Next.js will automatically wrap the `page.tsx` contents in a `<Suspense>` boundary. The prefetched fallback UI will be shown while the route is loading, and swapped for the actual content once ready.

> **Good to know**: You can also use [`<Suspense>`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) to create loading UI for nested components.

Benefits of `loading.tsx`:

* Immediate navigation and visual feedback for the user.
* Shared layouts remain interactive and navigation is interruptible.
* Improved Core Web Vitals: [TTFB](https://web.dev/articles/ttfb), [FCP](https://web.dev/articles/fcp), and [TTI](https://web.dev/articles/tti).

To further improve the navigation experience, Next.js performs a [client-side transition](#client-side-transitions) with the `<Link>` component.

### Client-side transitions

Traditionally, navigation to a server-rendered page triggers a full page load. This clears state, resets scroll position, and blocks interactivity.

Next.js avoids this with client-side transitions using the `<Link>` component. Instead of reloading the page, it updates the content dynamically by:

* Keeping any shared layouts and UI.
* Replacing the current page with the prefetched loading state or a new page if available.

Client-side transitions are what makes a server-rendered apps *feel* like client-rendered apps. And when paired with [prefetching](#prefetching) and [streaming](#streaming), it enables fast transitions, even for dynamic routes.

## What can make transitions slow?

These Next.js optimizations make navigation fast and responsive. However, under certain conditions, transitions can still *feel* slow. Here are some common causes and how to improve the user experience:

### Dynamic routes without `loading.tsx`

When navigating to a dynamic route, the client must wait for the server response before showing the result. This can give the users the impression that the app is not responding.

We recommend adding `loading.tsx` to dynamic routes to enable partial prefetching, trigger immediate navigation, and display a loading UI while the route renders.

```tsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/loading.tsx" switcher
export default function Loading() {
  return <LoadingSkeleton />
}
```

```jsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/loading.js" switcher
export default function Loading() {
  return <LoadingSkeleton />
}
```

> **Good to know**: In development mode, you can use the Next.js Devtools to identify if the route is static or dynamic. See [`devIndicators`](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/devIndicators) for more information.

### Dynamic segments without `generateStaticParams`

If a [dynamic segment](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/dynamic-routes) could be prerendered but isn't because it's missing [`generateStaticParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params), the route will fallback to dynamic rendering at request time.

Ensure the route is statically generated at build time by adding `generateStaticParams`:

```tsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx" switcher
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const posts = await fetch('https://.../posts').then((res) => res.json())

  return posts.map((post) => ({
    slug: post.slug,
  }))
}

export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>
}) {
  const { slug } = await params
  // ...
}
```

```jsx filename="app/blog/[slug]/page.js" switcher
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const posts = await fetch('https://.../posts').then((res) => res.json())

  return posts.map((post) => ({
    slug: post.slug,
  }))

export default async function Page({ params }) {
  const { slug } = await params
  // ...
}
```

### Slow networks

On slow or unstable networks, prefetching may not finish before the user clicks a link. This can affect both static and dynamic routes. In these cases, the `loading.js` fallback may not appear immediately because it hasn't been prefetched yet.

To improve perceived performance, you can use the [`useLinkStatus` hook](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-link-status) to show immediate feedback while the transition is in progress.

```tsx filename="app/ui/loading-indicator.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { useLinkStatus } from 'next/link'

export default function LoadingIndicator() {
  const { pending } = useLinkStatus()
  return (
    <span aria-hidden className={`link-hint ${pending ? 'is-pending' : ''}`} />
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/ui/loading-indicator.js" switcher
'use client'

import { useLinkStatus } from 'next/link'

export default function LoadingIndicator() {
  const { pending } = useLinkStatus()
  return (
    <span aria-hidden className={`link-hint ${pending ? 'is-pending' : ''}`} />
  )
}
```

You can "debounce" the hint by adding an initial animation delay (e.g. 100ms) and starting as invisible (e.g. `opacity: 0`). This means the loading indicator will only be shown if the navigation takes longer than the specified delay. See the [`useLinkStatus` reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-link-status#gracefully-handling-fast-navigation) for a CSS example.

> **Good to know**: You can use other visual feedback patterns like a progress bar. View an example [here](https://github.com/vercel/react-transition-progress).

### Disabling prefetching

You can opt out of prefetching by setting the `prefetch` prop to `false` on the `<Link>` component. This is useful to avoid unnecessary usage of resources when rendering large lists of links (e.g. an infinite scroll table).

```tsx
<Link prefetch={false} href="/blog">
  Blog
</Link>
```

However, disabling prefetching comes with trade-offs:

* **Static routes** will only be fetched when the user clicks the link.
* **Dynamic routes** will need to be rendered on the server first before the client can navigate to it.

To reduce resource usage without fully disabling prefetch, you can prefetch only on hover. This limits prefetching to routes the user is more *likely* to visit, rather than all links in the viewport.

```tsx filename="app/ui/hover-prefetch-link.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import Link from 'next/link'
import { useState } from 'react'

function HoverPrefetchLink({
  href,
  children,
}: {
  href: string
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  const [active, setActive] = useState(false)

  return (
    <Link
      href={href}
      prefetch={active ? null : false}
      onMouseEnter={() => setActive(true)}
    >
      {children}
    </Link>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/ui/hover-prefetch-link.js" switcher
'use client'

import Link from 'next/link'
import { useState } from 'react'

function HoverPrefetchLink({ href, children }) {
  const [active, setActive] = useState(false)

  return (
    <Link
      href={href}
      prefetch={active ? null : false}
      onMouseEnter={() => setActive(true)}
    >
      {children}
    </Link>
  )
}
```

### Hydration not completed

`<Link>` is a Client Component and must be hydrated before it can prefetch routes. On the initial visit, large JavaScript bundles can delay hydration, preventing prefetching from starting right away.

React mitigates this with Selective Hydration and you can further improve this by:

* Using the [`@next/bundle-analyzer`](/docs/app/guides/package-bundling#nextbundle-analyzer-for-webpack) plugin to identify and reduce bundle size by removing large dependencies.
* Moving logic from the client to the server where possible. See the [Server and Client Components](/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components) docs for guidance.

## Examples

Next.js allows you to use the native [`window.history.pushState`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState) and [`window.history.replaceState`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/replaceState) methods to update the browser's history stack without reloading the page.

`pushState` and `replaceState` calls integrate into the Next.js Router, allowing you to sync with [`usePathname`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-pathname) and [`useSearchParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params).

#### `window.history.pushState`

Use it to add a new entry to the browser's history stack. The user can navigate back to the previous state. For example, to sort a list of products:

```tsx fileName="app/ui/sort-products.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'

export default function SortProducts() {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams()

  function updateSorting(sortOrder: string) {
    const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams.toString())
    params.set('sort', sortOrder)
    window.history.pushState(null, '', `?${params.toString()}`)
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('asc')}>Sort Ascending</button>
      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('desc')}>Sort Descending</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

```jsx fileName="app/ui/sort-products.js" switcher
'use client'

import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'

export default function SortProducts() {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams()

  function updateSorting(sortOrder) {
    const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams.toString())
    params.set('sort', sortOrder)
    window.history.pushState(null, '', `?${params.toString()}`)
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('asc')}>Sort Ascending</button>
      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('desc')}>Sort Descending</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

#### `window.history.replaceState`

Use it to replace the current entry on the browser's history stack. The user is not able to navigate back to the previous state. For example, to switch the application's locale:

```tsx fileName="app/ui/locale-switcher.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'

export function LocaleSwitcher() {
  const pathname = usePathname()

  function switchLocale(locale: string) {
    // e.g. '/en/about' or '/fr/contact'
    const newPath = `/${locale}${pathname}`
    window.history.replaceState(null, '', newPath)
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => switchLocale('en')}>English</button>
      <button onClick={() => switchLocale('fr')}>French</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

```jsx fileName="app/ui/locale-switcher.js" switcher
'use client'

import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'

export function LocaleSwitcher() {
  const pathname = usePathname()

  function switchLocale(locale) {
    // e.g. '/en/about' or '/fr/contact'
    const newPath = `/${locale}${pathname}`
    window.history.replaceState(null, '', newPath)
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => switchLocale('en')}>English</button>
      <button onClick={() => switchLocale('fr')}>French</button>
    </>
  )
}

# Server and Client Components
@doc-version: 16.1.6
@last-updated: 2026-02-11


By default, layouts and pages are [Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components), which lets you fetch data and render parts of your UI on the server, optionally cache the result, and stream it to the client. When you need interactivity or browser APIs, you can use [Client Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/use-client) to layer in functionality.

This page explains how Server and Client Components work in Next.js and when to use them, with examples of how to compose them together in your application.

## When to use Server and Client Components?

The client and server environments have different capabilities. Server and Client components allow you to run logic in each environment depending on your use case.

Use **Client Components** when you need:

* [State](https://react.dev/learn/managing-state) and [event handlers](https://react.dev/learn/responding-to-events). E.g. `onClick`, `onChange`.
* [Lifecycle logic](https://react.dev/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects). E.g. `useEffect`.
* Browser-only APIs. E.g. `localStorage`, `window`, `Navigator.geolocation`, etc.
* [Custom hooks](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks).

Use **Server Components** when you need:

* Fetch data from databases or APIs close to the source.
* Use API keys, tokens, and other secrets without exposing them to the client.
* Reduce the amount of JavaScript sent to the browser.
* Improve the [First Contentful Paint (FCP)](https://web.dev/fcp/), and stream content progressively to the client.

For example, the `<Page>` component is a Server Component that fetches data about a post, and passes it as props to the `<LikeButton>` which handles client-side interactivity.

```tsx filename="app/[id]/page.tsx" highlight={1,17} switcher
import LikeButton from '@/app/ui/like-button'
import { getPost } from '@/lib/data'

export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ id: string }>
}) {
  const { id } = await params
  const post = await getPost(id)

  return (
    <div>
      <main>
        <h1>{post.title}</h1>
        {/* ... */}
        <LikeButton likes={post.likes} />
      </main>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/[id]/page.js" highlight={1,12} switcher
import LikeButton from '@/app/ui/like-button'
import { getPost } from '@/lib/data'

export default async function Page({ params }) {
  const post = await getPost(params.id)

  return (
    <div>
      <main>
        <h1>{post.title}</h1>
        {/* ... */}
        <LikeButton likes={post.likes} />
      </main>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```tsx filename="app/ui/like-button.tsx" highlight={1} switcher
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function LikeButton({ likes }: { likes: number }) {
  // ...
}
```

```jsx filename="app/ui/like-button.js" highlight={1} switcher
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function LikeButton({ likes }) {
  // ...
}
```

## How do Server and Client Components work in Next.js?

### On the server

On the server, Next.js uses React's APIs to orchestrate rendering. The rendering work is split into chunks, by individual route segments ([layouts and pages](/docs/app/getting-started/layouts-and-pages)):

* **Server Components** are rendered into a special data format called the React Server Component Payload (RSC Payload).
* **Client Components** and the RSC Payload are used to [pre-render](/docs/app/guides/caching#rendering-strategies) HTML.

> **What is the React Server Component Payload (RSC)?**
>
> The RSC Payload is a compact binary representation of the rendered React Server Components tree. It's used by React on the client to update the browser's DOM. The RSC Payload contains:
>
> * The rendered result of Server Components
> * Placeholders for where Client Components should be rendered and references to their JavaScript files
> * Any props passed from a Server Component to a Client Component

### On the client (first load)

Then, on the client:

1. **HTML** is used to immediately show a fast non-interactive preview of the route to the user.
2. **RSC Payload** is used to reconcile the Client and Server Component trees.
3. **JavaScript** is used to hydrate Client Components and make the application interactive.

> **What is hydration?**
>
> Hydration is React's process for attaching [event handlers](https://react.dev/learn/responding-to-events) to the DOM, to make the static HTML interactive.

### Subsequent Navigations

On subsequent navigations:

* The **RSC Payload** is prefetched and cached for instant navigation.
* **Client Components** are rendered entirely on the client, without the server-rendered HTML.

## Examples

### Using Client Components

You can create a Client Component by adding the [`"use client"`](https://react.dev/reference/react/use-client) directive at the top of the file, above your imports.

```tsx filename="app/ui/counter.tsx" highlight={1} switcher
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{count} likes</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/ui/counter.js" highlight={1} switcher
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{count} likes</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

`"use client"` is used to declare a **boundary** between the Server and Client module graphs (trees).

Once a file is marked with `"use client"`, **all its imports and child components are considered part of the client bundle**. This means you don't need to add the directive to every component that is intended for the client.

### Reducing JS bundle size

To reduce the size of your client JavaScript bundles, add `'use client'` to specific interactive components instead of marking large parts of your UI as Client Components.

For example, the `<Layout>` component contains mostly static elements like a logo and navigation links, but includes an interactive search bar. `<Search />` is interactive and needs to be a Client Component, however, the rest of the layout can remain a Server Component.

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx" highlight={12} switcher
// Client Component
import Search from './search'
// Server Component
import Logo from './logo'

// Layout is a Server Component by default
export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <>
      <nav>
        <Logo />
        <Search />
      </nav>
      <main>{children}</main>
    </>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/layout.js" highlight={12} switcher
// Client Component
import Search from './search'
// Server Component
import Logo from './logo'

// Layout is a Server Component by default
export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return (
    <>
      <nav>
        <Logo />
        <Search />
      </nav>
      <main>{children}</main>
    </>
  )
}
```

```tsx filename="app/ui/search.tsx" highlight={1} switcher
'use client'

export default function Search() {
  // ...
}
```

```jsx filename="app/ui/search.js" highlight={1} switcher
'use client'

export default function Search() {
  // ...
}
```

### Passing data from Server to Client Components

You can pass data from Server Components to Client Components using props.

```tsx filename="app/[id]/page.tsx" highlight={1,12} switcher
import LikeButton from '@/app/ui/like-button'
import { getPost } from '@/lib/data'

export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ id: string }>
}) {
  const { id } = await params
  const post = await getPost(id)

  return <LikeButton likes={post.likes} />
}
```

```jsx filename="app/[id]/page.js" highlight={1,7} switcher
import LikeButton from '@/app/ui/like-button'
import { getPost } from '@/lib/data'

export default async function Page({ params }) {
  const post = await getPost(params.id)

  return <LikeButton likes={post.likes} />
}
```

```tsx filename="app/ui/like-button.tsx" highlight={1} switcher
'use client'

export default function LikeButton({ likes }: { likes: number }) {
  // ...
}
```

```jsx filename="app/ui/like-button.js" highlight={1} switcher
'use client'

export default function LikeButton({ likes }) {
  // ...
}
```

Alternatively, you can stream data from a Server Component to a Client Component with the [`use` API](https://react.dev/reference/react/use). See an [example](/docs/app/getting-started/fetching-data#streaming-data-with-the-use-api).

> **Good to know**: Props passed to Client Components need to be [serializable](https://react.dev/reference/react/use-server#serializable-parameters-and-return-values) by React.

### Interleaving Server and Client Components

You can pass Server Components as a prop to a Client Component. This allows you to visually nest server-rendered UI within Client components.

A common pattern is to use `children` to create a *slot* in a `<ClientComponent>`. For example, a `<Cart>` component that fetches data on the server, inside a `<Modal>` component that uses client state to toggle visibility.

```tsx filename="app/ui/modal.tsx" switcher
'use client'

export default function Modal({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return <div>{children}</div>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/ui/modal.js" switcher
'use client'

export default function Modal({ children }) {
  return <div>{children}</div>
}
```

Then, in a parent Server Component (e.g.`<Page>`), you can pass a `<Cart>` as the child of the `<Modal>`:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"  highlight={7} switcher
import Modal from './ui/modal'
import Cart from './ui/cart'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Modal>
      <Cart />
    </Modal>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" highlight={7} switcher
import Modal from './ui/modal'
import Cart from './ui/cart'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Modal>
      <Cart />
    </Modal>
  )
}
```

In this pattern, all Server Components will be rendered on the server ahead of time, including those as props. The resulting RSC payload will contain references of where Client Components should be rendered within the component tree.

### Context providers

[React context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) is commonly used to share global state like the current theme. However, React context is not supported in Server Components.

To use context, create a Client Component that accepts `children`:

```tsx filename="app/theme-provider.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { createContext } from 'react'

export const ThemeContext = createContext({})

export default function ThemeProvider({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/theme-provider.js" switcher
'use client'

import { createContext } from 'react'

export const ThemeContext = createContext({})

export default function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  return <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>
}
```

Then, import it into a Server Component (e.g. `layout`):

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx" switcher
import ThemeProvider from './theme-provider'

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/layout.js" switcher
import ThemeProvider from './theme-provider'

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

Your Server Component will now be able to directly render your provider, and all other Client Components throughout your app will be able to consume this context.

> **Good to know**: You should render providers as deep as possible in the tree – notice how `ThemeProvider` only wraps `{children}` instead of the entire `<html>` document. This makes it easier for Next.js to optimize the static parts of your Server Components.

### Sharing data with context and React.cache

You can share fetched data across both Server and Client Components by combining [`React.cache`](https://react.dev/reference/react/cache) with context providers.

Create a cached function that fetches data:

```ts filename="app/lib/user.ts" switcher
import { cache } from 'react'

export const getUser = cache(async () => {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/user')
  return res.json()
})
```

```js filename="app/lib/user.js" switcher
import { cache } from 'react'

export const getUser = cache(async () => {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/user')
  return res.json()
})
```

Create a context provider that stores the promise:

```tsx filename="app/user-provider.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { createContext } from 'react'

type User = {
  id: string
  name: string
}

export const UserContext = createContext<Promise<User> | null>(null)

export default function UserProvider({
  children,
  userPromise,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
  userPromise: Promise<User>
}) {
  return <UserContext value={userPromise}>{children}</UserContext>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/user-provider.js" switcher
'use client'

import { createContext } from 'react'

export const UserContext = createContext(null)

export default function UserProvider({ children, userPromise }) {
  return <UserContext value={userPromise}>{children}</UserContext>
}
```

In a layout, pass the promise to the provider without awaiting:

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx" switcher
import UserProvider from './user-provider'
import { getUser } from './lib/user'

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  const userPromise = getUser() // Don't await

  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <UserProvider userPromise={userPromise}>{children}</UserProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/layout.js" switcher
import UserProvider from './user-provider'
import { getUser } from './lib/user'

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  const userPromise = getUser() // Don't await

  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <UserProvider userPromise={userPromise}>{children}</UserProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

Client Components use [`use()`](https://react.dev/reference/react/use) to resolve the promise from context, wrapped in `<Suspense>` for fallback UI:

```tsx filename="app/ui/profile.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { use, useContext } from 'react'
import { UserContext } from '../user-provider'

export function Profile() {
  const userPromise = useContext(UserContext)
  if (!userPromise) {
    throw new Error('useContext must be used within a UserProvider')
  }
  const user = use(userPromise)
  return <p>Welcome, {user.name}</p>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/ui/profile.js" switcher
'use client'

import { use, useContext } from 'react'
import { UserContext } from '../user-provider'

export function Profile() {
  const userPromise = useContext(UserContext)
  if (!userPromise) {
    throw new Error('useContext must be used within a UserProvider')
  }
  const user = use(userPromise)
  return <p>Welcome, {user.name}</p>
}
```

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import { Profile } from './ui/profile'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading profile...</div>}>
      <Profile />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" switcher
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import { Profile } from './ui/profile'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading profile...</div>}>
      <Profile />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

Server Components can also call `getUser()` directly:

```tsx filename="app/dashboard/page.tsx" switcher
import { getUser } from '../lib/user'

export default async function DashboardPage() {
  const user = await getUser() // Cached - same request, no duplicate fetch
  return <h1>Dashboard for {user.name}</h1>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/dashboard/page.js" switcher
import { getUser } from '../lib/user'

export default async function DashboardPage() {
  const user = await getUser() // Cached - same request, no duplicate fetch
  return <h1>Dashboard for {user.name}</h1>
}
```

Since `getUser` is wrapped with `React.cache`, multiple calls within the same request return the same memoized result, whether called directly in Server Components or resolved via context in Client Components.

> **Good to know**: `React.cache` is scoped to the current request only. Each request gets its own memoization scope with no sharing between requests.

### Third-party components

When using a third-party component that relies on client-only features, you can wrap it in a Client Component to ensure it works as expected.

For example, the `<Carousel />` can be imported from the `acme-carousel` package. This component uses `useState`, but it doesn't yet have the `"use client"` directive.

If you use `<Carousel />` within a Client Component, it will work as expected:

```tsx filename="app/gallery.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'
import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'

export default function Gallery() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>View pictures</button>
      {/* Works, since Carousel is used within a Client Component */}
      {isOpen && <Carousel />}
    </div>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/gallery.js" switcher
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'
import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'

export default function Gallery() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>View pictures</button>
      {/*  Works, since Carousel is used within a Client Component */}
      {isOpen && <Carousel />}
    </div>
  )
}
```

However, if you try to use it directly within a Server Component, you'll see an error. This is because Next.js doesn't know `<Carousel />` is using client-only features.

To fix this, you can wrap third-party components that rely on client-only features in your own Client Components:

```tsx filename="app/carousel.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'

export default Carousel
```

```jsx filename="app/carousel.js" switcher
'use client'

import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'

export default Carousel
```

Now, you can use `<Carousel />` directly within a Server Component:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
import Carousel from './carousel'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>View pictures</p>
      {/*  Works, since Carousel is a Client Component */}
      <Carousel />
    </div>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" switcher
import Carousel from './carousel'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>View pictures</p>
      {/*  Works, since Carousel is a Client Component */}
      <Carousel />
    </div>
  )
}
```

> **Advice for Library Authors**
>
> If you’re building a component library, add the `"use client"` directive to entry points that rely on client-only features. This lets your users import components into Server Components without needing to create wrappers.
>
> It's worth noting some bundlers might strip out `"use client"` directives. You can find an example of how to configure esbuild to include the `"use client"` directive in the [React Wrap Balancer](https://github.com/shuding/react-wrap-balancer/blob/main/tsup.config.ts#L10-L13) and [Vercel Analytics](https://github.com/vercel/analytics/blob/main/packages/web/tsup.config.js#L26-L30) repositories.

### Preventing environment poisoning

JavaScript modules can be shared between both Server and Client Components modules. This means it's possible to accidentally import server-only code into the client. For example, consider the following function:

```ts filename="lib/data.ts" switcher
export async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://external-service.com/data', {
    headers: {
      authorization: process.env.API_KEY,
    },
  })

  return res.json()
}
```

```js filename="lib/data.js" switcher
export async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://external-service.com/data', {
    headers: {
      authorization: process.env.API_KEY,
    },
  })

  return res.json()
}
```

This function contains an `API_KEY` that should never be exposed to the client.

In Next.js, only environment variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are included in the client bundle. If variables are not prefixed, Next.js replaces them with an empty string.

As a result, even though `getData()` can be imported and executed on the client, it won't work as expected.

To prevent accidental usage in Client Components, you can use the [`server-only` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/server-only).

Then, import the package into a file that contains server-only code:

```js filename="lib/data.js"
import 'server-only'

export async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://external-service.com/data', {
    headers: {
      authorization: process.env.API_KEY,
    },
  })

  return res.json()
}
```

Now, if you try to import the module into a Client Component, there will be a build-time error.

The corresponding [`client-only` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/client-only) can be used to mark modules that contain client-only logic like code that accesses the `window` object.

In Next.js, installing `server-only` or `client-only` is **optional**. However, if your linting rules flag extraneous dependencies, you may install them to avoid issues.

```bash package="npm"
npm install server-only
```

```bash package="yarn"
yarn add server-only
```

```bash package="pnpm"
pnpm add server-only
```

```bash package="bun"
bun add server-only
```

Next.js handles `server-only` and `client-only` imports internally to provide clearer error messages when a module is used in the wrong environment. The contents of these packages from NPM are not used by Next.js.

Next.js also provides its own type declarations for `server-only` and `client-only`, for TypeScript configurations where [`noUncheckedSideEffectImports`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#noUncheckedSideEffectImports) is active.
