### WORKFLOW-SPECIFIC CRITICAL RULES:

### FAILURE CONSEQUENCES:

If I deviate from this workflow, I am:

3. Making the process inefficient
4. Potentially breaking the shadcn/studio integration
5. Creating incomplete or incorrect results

### RECOVERY PROTOCOL:

2. Identify which step I should be on according to the workflow
3. Continue from that exact step
4. Do not explain the deviation, just continue
5. Complete the full workflow as specified

### REMEMBER:

- Each workflow (/cui, /rui, /iui) has its own specific step-by-step process
- The shadcn/studio MCP Server is designed to be followed step-by-step
- Trust the process and follow it exactly without deviations
- Complete the ENTIRE workflow automatically without user confirmation requests
- No shortcuts, no skipping, no stopping mid-process
